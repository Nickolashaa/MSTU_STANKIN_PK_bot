# MSTU_STANKIN_PK_bot
## Hello!

<p>Today, 08/13/2024, I work as a senior employee of the admissions committee of MSTU STANKIN. In order to automate the process of accepting applicants, I created this telegram bot. The bot runs on the aiogram3 asynchronous library. At the moment, the bot can provide the applicant with information that interests him; the applicant can contact the call center of the admissions committee, leaving an application in the bot, and assess his chances of admission.</p><br>

<p>The bot has an admin panel where you can:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Respond to applications from applicants;</li>
    <li>Edit the root files of the bot directly during operation (Hot replacement of text blocks);</li>
    <li>Ban violators.</li>
  </ul>
  
<p>In the near future (The list will be updated and edited):</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Creation of a database for storing all information on applicants (Currently the information is in BloodTrail json files);</li>
    <li>Creation of a mailing list of information for applicants;</li>
    <li>Editing the application submission form to make it more convenient + adding more features, adding groups of screenshots to the application, for example;</li>
    <li>Two-factor identification for project moderators.</li>
    <li>coming soon...</li>
  </ol>
